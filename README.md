# Most-Finetuned: Optimizing Neural Networks to the Max

Applying a ridiculous amount of optimization, pruning, and quantization techniques to various neural network architectures.<br>
The goal is to demonstrate how to maximize model efficiency without significantly sacrificing performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

The general aim of neural network optimization is to:
1. Reduce model size
2. Increase training efficiency
3. Decrease inference time
4. Lower memory usage
5. Maintain or even improve model accuracy

Exploring and implementing state-of-the-art techniques to optimize different types of neural networks, including:

- Image Classifiers (CNN-based and plain MLP-based)
- Language Models (Transformer-based and LSTM-based)
- Reinforcement Learning Models
- Generative Models
